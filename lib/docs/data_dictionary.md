# Data Dictionary

Effective use of `pgfinder` requires an understanding of the inputs and outputs of the software.

## Inputs

`pgfinder` takes data from mass spectrometry instruments, as well as a "database" of expected
masses and some user specified modifications.

### FTRS Files

This is a file corresponding to deconvolution data generated by the [Byos®](https://proteinmetrics.com/byos/)
 software with the extension `.ftrs`.

### MaxQuant Files

MaxQuant Files are output by the [MaxQuant](https://www.maxquant.org/) software. They are
tab separated value (`TSV`) files with a `.txt` extension.

### Modifications

Any number of modifications can be selected to enrich the search space of the database of masses
to which the input data is being compared. Allowed mofifications are:

| Modification | Description |
|---|---|
| Sodium	| Search for masses corresponding to sodium adducts |
| Potassium	| Search for masses corresponding to potassium adducts |
| Anh	| Search for anhydromuropeptides |
| DeAc	| Search for deacetylated muropeptides |
| DeAc_Anh	| Search for deacetylated anhydromuropeptides |
| Nude	| Search for muropeptides with an extra GlcNAc-MurNAc disaccharide |
| Decay	| Correct output taking into account in-source decay products |
| Amidation | Search for Amidated muropeptides |
| Amidase	| Search for peptides resulting from amidase cleavage (GlcNAc-MurNAc loss) |
| Double_Anh	| Search for anhydromuropeptides (2 Anhydro groups) |
| Multimers	| Search for multimers resulting from 3-3 and 4-3 crosslinks |
| Multimers | Glyco	Search for multimers resulting from transglycosylation (no transpeptidation |
| Multimer Lac	| Search for lactyl-peptides multimers |
| O-Ac	| Search for O-acetylated muropeptides |

### Mass Databases (Lists)

Mass databases are lists of structures and their associated mass. They are in `CSV` format
with a `.csv` extension. `pgfinder` has built-in mass lists for *Escherichia coli* and
*Clostridium difficle*, but can take a different mass list as an input.

| Column           | Description       | Unit             |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Structure        | Structure code    | NA               |
| Monoisotopicmass | Monoisotopic mass | atomic mass unit |

## Outputs

`pgfinder` outputs `CSV` (`.csv`) files. The columns in these files depend on the input file format.


### Embedded Metadata

The first column contains the following metadata

| Data | Description |
|---|---|
| `file` | Input data file |
| `masses_file` | Mass list file |
| `rt_window` | Retention time window |
| `modifications` | List of [modifications](#modifications) |
| `ppm` | ppm tolerance |
| `consolidation_ppm` | ppm tolerance for consolidation |
| `version` | PGFinder version used in analysis |
